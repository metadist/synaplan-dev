+ - Widget management with live preview
+ - Custom dialogs replacing native alerts
+ 
+ ### üöß In Development
+ - File upload and text extraction (Tika/OCR)
+ - Document summarization and analysis
+ - Vector storage and RAG search
+ - Message queues for async processing
+ - Media generation (images, videos, audio via commands)
+ - Web search integration (`/search` command)
+ - Office document generation
+ - Advanced widget analytics
+ - Multi-language support
+ 
+ ## Project Structure

+ ```
+ 
+ ## Testing
+ 
+ ### Backend
+ ```bash
+ cd backend
+ make test-up              # Start test infrastructure
+ make test                 # Run all tests
+ make test-unit            # Unit tests only
+ make test-down            # Stop test infrastructure
+ ```
+ 
+ See `backend/_devextras/README_TESTING.md` for details.
+ 
+ ### Frontend
+ ```bash
+ cd frontend
+ npm run test              # Run tests
+ npm run test:coverage     # With coverage
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Environment Configuration
+ 
+ ### Backend
+ - `.env.local` - Local development config (create from `.env.example`)
+ - `.env.test` - Testing config (committed)
+ - Development: Ports 8000, 3307 (MariaDB), 6380 (Redis)
+ - Testing: Ports 8001, 3308, 6381 (isolated services)
+ 
+ ### Frontend
+ - `.env` - Development config
+ - Enable `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=true` for frontend-only development
+ - Set `VITE_AUTO_LOGIN_DEV=true` to bypass authentication in dev
+ 
+ ## Development Guidelines
+ 
+ ### Frontend
+ - Use Composition API with TypeScript
+ - Follow design tokens in `style.css` (no inline colors)
+ - All text via i18n (`$t()` function)
+ - Mock data in `src/mocks/` until backend integration
+ - Keep components small and focused
+ 
+ ### Backend
+ - Database-driven configuration (no hardcoded models/prompts)
+ - Use circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
+ - Follow architecture docs in `backend/refactor_plan/`
+ - Add fixtures for test data
+ 
+ ## Commands System
+ 
+ Chat supports special commands:
+ - `/pic [description]` - Generate images
+ - `/vid [description]` - Generate videos
+ - `/search [query]` - Web search
+ - `/lang [target] [text]` - Translation
+ - `/web [url]` - Website screenshots
+ - `/docs [query]` - Document search
+ - `/link` - Profile linking
+ 
+ ## Documentation
+ 
+ - **Backend Architecture:** `backend/refactor_plan/`
+ - **Frontend Design System:** `frontend/AI-README.md`
+ - **Testing Guide:** `backend/_devextras/README_TESTING.md`
+ - **Email API:** `backend/_devextras/RESEND_EMAIL_API.md`
+ - **Dev Commands:** `_devextras/DEV_COMMANDS.md`
+ 
+ ## Known Limitations
+ 
+ - File upload UI exists but backend processing incomplete
+ - Widget analytics not implemented
+ - Commands system partially functional
+ - Single language (English) only
+ - No production deployment configuration yet
+ 
+ ## Requirements
+ 
+ - **Backend:** Docker, Docker Compose
+ - **Frontend:** Node.js 16+, npm/pnpm
+ - **AI Services:** At least one provider configured (API keys)
+ 
+ ## Contributing
+ 
+ 1. Follow existing code style and conventions
+ 2. Add tests for new features
+ 3. Update i18n for UI text changes
+ 4. Document complex logic
+ 5. Keep commits focused and descriptive
+ 
+ ## License

Fertig! Ich habe eine zusammengefasste README erstellt, die:

‚úÖ **Den Entwicklungszustand klarstellt** - Mit einem deutlichen Warning am Anfang, dass das Projekt in Entwicklung und nicht production-ready ist

‚úÖ **Features nach Status gruppiert**:
- "‚úÖ Working" - Was bereits funktioniert
- "üöß In Development" - Was noch in Arbeit ist

‚úÖ **Beide Setups kombiniert** - Frontend und Backend Quick Start Anleitungen

‚úÖ **Wichtigste Infos kompakt** - Von ~290 Zeilen (Frontend) + ~100 Zeilen (Backend) auf ~180 Zeilen reduziert

‚úÖ **Alles auf Englisch** - Wie gew√ºnscht

‚úÖ **Known Limitations** - Zeigt ehrlich, was noch fehlt

Die neue README befindet sich im Root-Verzeichnis des Projekts und gibt einen schnellen, aber vollst√§ndigen √úberblick √ºber das Gesamtprojekt.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+ 
+       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+ 
+    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+ 
+    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+       as of the date such litigation is filed.
+ 
+    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+       meet the following conditions:
+ 
+       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+ 
+       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+           stating that You changed the files; and
+ 
+       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+           the Derivative Works; and
+ 
+       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+           as modifying the License.
+ 
+       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+       the conditions stated in this License.
+ 
+    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+ 
+    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+ 
+    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+ 
+    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+ 
+    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+ 
+    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+ 
+    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
+ 
+       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
+       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
+       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
+       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
+       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
+       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
+       identification within third-party archives.
